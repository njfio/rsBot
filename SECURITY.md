# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for potential security vulnerabilities.

Use one of these channels:

1. GitHub Security Advisory (preferred): open a private advisory in this repository.
2. If advisory workflow is unavailable, open a private maintainer contact request and include repro details, affected versions/commit, and impact.

Include:

- Vulnerability description and impact.
- Reproduction steps or proof-of-concept.
- Suspected affected components/crates.
- Suggested mitigation (if known).

## Response Expectations

Initial triage target: within 3 business days.

After triage, maintainers will:

- Confirm severity and scope.
- Share remediation plan and expected fix window.
- Coordinate validation for the fix before disclosure.

## Coordinated Disclosure

Please allow time for a patch before public disclosure.

When a fix is ready:

- A patch PR/release will be prepared.
- Advisories/changelog notes will describe impacted versions and upgrade path.
- Credit will be provided when requested.
