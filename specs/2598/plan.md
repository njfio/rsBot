# Plan #2598

1. Re-run #2597 conformance commands and capture deterministic outputs.
2. Execute scoped quality gates (`fmt`, `clippy`, targeted tests) and mutation-in-diff.
3. Execute sanitized live smoke and record summary.
4. Update `specs/2597/*`, `specs/2598/*`, and issue comments with closure evidence.
