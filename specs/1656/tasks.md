# Issue 1656 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): capture helper baseline findings and identify noisy pattern
distribution as RED evidence.

T2: calibrate anti-pattern policy to reduce false-positive noise.

T3: generate scored spot-audit artifacts (JSON + Markdown) with checklist and
sample review table.

T4: update remediation guide references and rerun helper/docs checks.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: spot-audit rubric/checklist/report artifacts exist and are readable
- Conformance: score threshold and sample scoring data are present
- Regression: helper before/after comparison reflects noise reduction after policy calibration
- Integration: remediation guide references the spot-audit artifacts
