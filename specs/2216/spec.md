# Spec #2216

Status: Implemented
Milestone: specs/milestones/m42/index.md
Issue: https://github.com/njfio/Tau/issues/2216

## Problem Statement

Epic #2216 must provide closure traceability for the M42 P0 provider/catalog
execution wave by confirming child implementation and verification artifacts are
complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: Story `#2217`, task `#2218`, and subtask `#2219` are completed and closed with `status:done`.
- AC-2: M42 objective evidence is present in milestone and child issue artifacts.
- AC-3: Epic closure metadata and conformance summary are complete.

## Scope

In:

- epic-level roll-up artifacts under `specs/2216/`
- descendant closure verification and status updates

Out:

- additional provider feature work outside the child implementation slice

## Conformance Cases

- C-01 (AC-1, conformance): `#2217/#2218/#2219` show closed + `status:done`.
- C-02 (AC-2, conformance): `specs/milestones/m42/index.md` and child specs show `Status: Implemented`.
- C-03 (AC-3, conformance): epic `#2216` closure includes milestone/spec/PR traceability.

## Success Metrics

- Epic #2216 closes with complete artifact traceability.
