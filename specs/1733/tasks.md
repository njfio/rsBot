# Issue 1733 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): capture baseline gap (missing phase/stage skeleton doc and
no direct planning link in roadmap docs).

T2: author `docs/planning/true-rl-roadmap-skeleton.md` with ordered phases and
issue mappings.

T3: add cross-links from training/naming docs to the new roadmap skeleton.

T4: run docs link checks and finalize issue evidence.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: roadmap skeleton readability and navigation
- Conformance: phase-to-issue mapping coverage
- Regression: docs link checks remain green
