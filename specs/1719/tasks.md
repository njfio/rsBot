# Issue 1719 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): capture RED evidence that docs currently lack explicit
cross-links to Epic `#1657` and Milestone `#24`.

T2: patch user-facing docs with dual-track wording and direct links.

T3: run docs link checks and targeted grep validation for roadmap references.

T4: finalize issue evidence and close with PR linkage.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: operator-visible wording in README and training runbook
- Conformance: Epic/Milestone links present
- Regression: docs link check suite remains green
