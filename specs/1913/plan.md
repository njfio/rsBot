# Issue 1913 Plan

Status: Reviewed

## Approach

1. Create `specs/milestones/m24/index.md` with objective, scope, active issues,
   and contract requirements.
2. Update GitHub milestone `#24` description to include index path reference.
3. Verify repository and milestone metadata.

## Affected Areas

- `specs/milestones/m24/index.md`
- GitHub milestone `#24` description

## Risks And Mitigations

- Risk: milestone description overwrite removes existing context.
  - Mitigation: preserve existing description text and append spec link line.

## ADR

No architecture/dependency/protocol change. ADR not required.
