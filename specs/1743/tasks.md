# Issue 1743 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add failing regression test for benchmark report validator
covering schema, naming, and retention failures.

T2: add benchmark report template and validator script.

T3: update training operations guide with publication format and archival policy.

T4: run formatter and validator tests; capture AC evidence.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: valid publication report passes validator
- Regression: invalid naming/retention reports fail deterministically
