# M180 - Under-tested Crate Coverage Wave 2

## Context
The revalidation inventory still flags low direct crate-local test depth on selected surfaces. This milestone starts a focused wave to raise coverage with small spec-driven slices.

## Scope
- Add targeted crate-local tests where direct boundary/regression coverage is thin.
- Keep each slice narrow, with explicit conformance mappings and RED/GREEN evidence.
