# M182 - Contributor and Security Policy Docs

## Context
Root `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md` are missing. Contributors and operators need explicit workflow and vulnerability-reporting guidance.

## Scope
- Add root contributor guide with branch/test/PR expectations.
- Add root security policy with reporting channel, response, and disclosure process.
- Add deterministic conformance checks for required sections.
