# M58 — Spacebot Comparison Gap Closure (Wave 1)

Milestone: [GitHub milestone #58](https://github.com/njfio/Tau/milestone/58)

## Objective

Convert `tasks/spacebot-comparison.md` into executable, spec-driven delivery and
land the first high-impact runtime gap closure with live validation evidence.

## Scope

- Intake and track Spacebot comparison gaps using milestone/epic/story/task/subtask hierarchy.
- Implement P0 communication improvement G11 (message coalescing) in multi-channel runtime.
- Validate through deterministic conformance tests plus live runner execution evidence.

## Out of Scope

- Full implementation of all G1-G23 gaps in a single milestone.
- Dependency-heavy tracks requiring separate approval (for example local embedding backend changes).

## Linked Hierarchy

- Epic: #2354
- Story: #2355
- Task: #2356
- Subtask: #2357
