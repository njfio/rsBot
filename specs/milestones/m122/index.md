# M122 - Spacebot G18 Decision Checklist Closure

## Context
`tasks/spacebot-comparison.md` still shows unchecked G18 decision/stack rows even though the decision and stack selection were already recorded in `docs/architecture/adr-006-dashboard-ui-stack.md`.

## Linked Work
- Epic: #2752
- Story: #2753
- Task: #2754
- Source checklist: `tasks/spacebot-comparison.md` (G18 decision + stack rows)

## Scope
- Validate current dashboard decision state against ADR-006.
- Update G18 checklist rows with checked status and issue evidence.
- Keep checklist wording and file references accurate.

## Exit Criteria
- Both G18 decision rows are checked with traceable evidence.
- Checklist text aligns with ADR-006 and current repository state.
- Task/story/epic and milestone are closed.
