# M211 - README Capability Sync (Ops Dashboard)

Status: In Progress

## Context
Root `README.md` should reflect currently merged operator/dashboard capabilities without understating or overstating runtime state.

## Scope
- Align README capability bullets with merged `/ops/*` dashboard shell contracts.
- Clarify dashboard status boundary language.
- Keep docs-only scope (no runtime behavior changes).
