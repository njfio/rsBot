# M183 - README + Operator/API Docs and Archive Workflow Refresh

## Context
Operators requested clearer capability positioning in README, explicit operator runbook/API reference coverage for the current gateway surface (70+ routes), and reliable archival workflow for completed specs/merged branches.

## Scope
- Refresh `README.md` with current "what Tau is/does" narrative and capability map.
- Refresh operator deployment guide and gateway API reference with current route coverage signals.
- Add deterministic implemented-spec archival index generation and branch archival workflow linkage.
- Add conformance scripts validating docs and archive artifacts.
