# M179 - Tau Gaps Revalidation Refresh

## Context
`tasks/tau-gaps-issues-improvements.md` drifted from current repository and issue state. It still reports some already-closed M104 follow-up issues as open/partial and includes stale metadata snapshots.

## Scope
- Revalidate roadmap status rows against current repo + issue evidence.
- Refresh follow-up issue status section to reflect closed/open truth.
- Keep the evidence-first comparison table structure.
- Add a deterministic conformance script for the refreshed document.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #3002
- Story: #3003
- Task: #3004
