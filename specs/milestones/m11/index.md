- MCP client mode with OAuth
- undo/redo agent tools

## Active Spec-Driven Issues (current lane)

- `#1454` Story: 2.5 MCP Client Mode with OAuth 2.1

## Contract

Each implementation issue under this milestone must maintain:

- `specs/<issue-id>/tasks.md`

No implementation is considered complete until acceptance criteria are mapped to
conformance tests and verified in PR evidence.
