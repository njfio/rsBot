# M104 - Tau Gaps Revalidation and Remediation Wave

Status: In Progress
Related roadmap items: `tasks/tau-gaps-issues-improvements.md` (all sections; prioritized roadmap items 1..23)

## Objective
Revalidate every claim in `tasks/tau-gaps-issues-improvements.md` against current HEAD, remediate the still-open high-priority gaps that are tractable in one delivery slice, and create issue/spec follow-ups for remaining larger architecture work.

## Issue Map
- Epic: #2605
- Story: #2606
- Task: #2607

## Deliverables
- Evidence-backed per-item status refresh in `tasks/tau-gaps-issues-improvements.md`.
- P0/P1 hygiene artifacts added where missing (`.env.example`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `rustfmt.toml`).
- `tau-safety` test hardening with expanded conformance/regression cases.
- Follow-up implementation issues for non-trivial remaining open items.

## Exit Criteria
- #2605, #2606, #2607 closed.
- `specs/2607/spec.md` status set to `Implemented`.
- `tasks/tau-gaps-issues-improvements.md` reflects validated current state with issue/spec evidence links.
