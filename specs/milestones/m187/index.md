# M187 - Contributor and Security Policy Docs

## Context
Tau requires a clear contributor workflow and explicit vulnerability reporting guidance at repository root so external contributors and operators can onboard safely without relying on tribal knowledge.

## Scope
- Validate and harden root `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidance for issue/spec/test/PR flow.
- Validate and harden root `SECURITY.md` guidance for private reporting, triage SLAs, and coordinated disclosure.
- Ensure discoverability from `README.md` and docs conformance automation.
