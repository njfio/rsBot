# M185 - Crate Dependency Architecture Diagram Publication

## Context
Current docs call out that a consolidated crate dependency architecture diagram is still missing. Contributors and operators need an up-to-date map of workspace crate relationships for impact analysis and onboarding.

## Scope
- Add deterministic dependency graph extraction/report script.
- Publish machine-readable and markdown report artifacts.
- Publish architecture documentation that links command contracts and generated artifacts.
- Add conformance tests to prevent drift.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #3026
- Story: #3027
- Task: #3028
