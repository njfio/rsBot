# M56 — Model Catalog Discovery Claim Closure

Milestone: [GitHub milestone #56](https://github.com/njfio/Tau/milestone/56)

remote-source merge policy by validating existing behavior with executable
tests and updating roadmap evidence.

## Scope

- Validate cache write/reuse and cache-fallback behavior on remote failure.
- Add one deterministic verifier script that runs mapped conformance tests.
- Update `tasks/resolution-roadmap.md` claim line to resolved with command
  evidence.

## Out of Scope

- Reworking model-catalog architecture or transport.
- Broad model-list refresh for every provider in this milestone.
