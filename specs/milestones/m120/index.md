# M120 - Spacebot G18 Dashboard Architecture Decision and Stack Selection

## Context
After delivering embedded `/dashboard` shell and API-backed priority pages, G18 still has unresolved checklist decisions for architecture location and tech stack choice.

## Linked Work
- Epic: #2744
- Story: #2745
- Task: #2746
- Source parity checklist: `tasks/spacebot-comparison.md` (G18 decision + tech stack lines)

## Scope
- Publish ADR capturing dashboard architecture location and selected implementation stack.
- Align G18 checklist decision rows with ADR-backed evidence.
- Keep decision consistent with current gateway-hosted shell trajectory.

## Exit Criteria
- ADR exists with clear Context/Decision/Consequences.
- G18 decision and tech stack checklist rows are checked with linked issue evidence.
- Documentation remains internally consistent.
