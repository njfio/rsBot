# M16: P6 Deployment API

Milestone: `Gap List P6 Deployment API` (`#16`)

## Scope

Deliver deployment and API parity:

- OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
- full web UI for runtime operations
- multi-platform release pipeline automation

## Active Spec-Driven Issues (current lane)

- `#1428` Epic: P6 Deployment and API Parity (5.1-5.3)
- `#1474` Story: 5.1 OpenAI-Compatible REST API Endpoints
- `#1475` Story: 5.2 Full Web UI for Runtime Operations
- `#1476` Story: 5.3 Multi-Platform Binary Release Pipeline

## Contract

Each implementation issue under this milestone must maintain:

- `specs/<issue-id>/tasks.md`

No implementation is considered complete until acceptance criteria are mapped to
conformance tests and verified in PR evidence.
