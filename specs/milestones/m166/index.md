# Milestone M166 - Tau Ops Dashboard Accessibility Contracts

Status: InProgress

## Scope
Implement Tau Ops dashboard accessibility acceptance contracts from PRD checklist items `2155-2159`:
- accessibility conformance marker surface,
- keyboard navigation markers,
- dynamic live-region markers,
- focus indicator contract markers,
- reduced-motion contract markers.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #2937
- Story: #2945
- Task: #2946

## Success Signals
- Accessibility contract markers are rendered in `tau-dashboard-ui`.
- Conformance tests map to PRD accessibility checklist contracts.
- Existing dashboard contract suites remain green.
