# M22: Prompt Optimization Naming Alignment

Milestone: `Gap Closure Wave 2026-04: Prompt Optimization Naming Alignment` (`#22`)

## Scope

Align repository language with current capabilities by removing stale RL
wording for prompt optimization paths while preserving approved references for
future true-RL roadmap content.

Core tracks:

- terminology scan and reporting for stale RL references
- compatibility alias behavior and warning text stability
- approved allowlist policy for future-RL contexts

## Active Spec-Driven Issues (current lane)

- `#1700` Gate M22 naming-alignment exit
- `#1705` Run terminology regression scan for M22
- `#1706` Validate compatibility alias behavior
- `#1755` Establish approved RL-term allowlist
- `#1756` Add compatibility alias warning snapshots

## Contract

Each implementation issue under this milestone must include:

- `specs/<issue-id>/spec.md`
- `specs/<issue-id>/plan.md`
- `specs/<issue-id>/tasks.md`

No implementation is complete until acceptance criteria map to conformance
tests and PR evidence captures red/green execution.
