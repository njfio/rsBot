# Milestone M127 - G20 Crypto Dependency Hardening

Status: InProgress

## Scope
Close the remaining unchecked G20 pathway item in `tasks/spacebot-comparison.md` by formalizing approved cryptography/storage dependency posture and validating encrypted secret-store behavior.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #2772
- Story: #2773
- Task: #2774

## Success Signals
- Workspace dependency posture includes approved G20 cryptography/storage crates.
- Secret-store keyed mode uses strong authenticated encryption for new writes.
- Existing encrypted credential store data remains readable (backward compatible).
- Roadmap evidence row is checked with issue linkage.
