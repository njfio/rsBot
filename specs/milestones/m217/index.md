# M217 - Review #35 Property-Gap Closure Sync

Status: In Progress

## Context
Property-test depth wave 2 (`#3156`, PR `#3157`) is merged, but `tasks/review-35.md` and `scripts/dev/test-review-35.sh` still describe property-based testing as partially remaining.

## Scope
- Update Review #35 closure tracker to mark property-based testing status as done.
- Update Review #35 conformance script assertions to match the merged closure state.

## Linked Issues
- Epic: #3158
- Story: #3159
- Task: #3160

## Success Signals
- `scripts/dev/test-review-35.sh` passes.
- Review #35 closure table no longer lists property-based testing as remaining.
