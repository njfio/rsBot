# Spec #2224

Status: Draft
Milestone: specs/milestones/m43/index.md
Issue: https://github.com/njfio/Tau/issues/2224

## Problem Statement

Epic #2224 must provide closure traceability for restoring Gemini live-provider
compatibility, ensuring all descendant implementation and validation artifacts
are complete.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: Story `#2225`, task `#2226`, and subtask `#2227` close with `status:done`.
- AC-2: M43 milestone and child specs contain implemented evidence.
- AC-3: Epic closure metadata is complete.

## Conformance Cases

- C-01 (AC-1): descendants are closed with `status:done`.
- C-02 (AC-2): child specs show `Status: Implemented`.
- C-03 (AC-3): epic issue closed with traceability metadata.
