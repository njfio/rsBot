# Issue 1699 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): run gate contract tests for oversized-file and safety
live-proof validation.

T2: regenerate M21 validation artifacts (`m21-validation-matrix` and
`m21-tool-split-validation`).

T3: verify milestone state and close remaining M21 story/epic containers.

T4: run roadmap status sync check and publish closure evidence in issue/PR.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: milestone-state checks + closure evidence review
- Conformance: C-01..C-04 mapped to scripts and artifact regeneration
- Regression: guardrail contract scripts (`oversized-file`, `safety live-run`)
