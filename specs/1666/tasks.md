# Issue 1666 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): rerun conformance tests for burst no-drop and stale
retry/requeue recovery.

T2: rerun live harness script and confirm metric emission.

T3: map ACs to conformance evidence and finalize parent-task closure artifacts.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: harness metric emission
- Integration: concurrent collector burst completion
- Regression: stale timeout/requeue recovery path
