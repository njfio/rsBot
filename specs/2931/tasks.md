# Tasks: Issue #2931 - Implement and validate cortex LLM readiness contracts

1. [x] T1 (RED): capture baseline cortex status contract gap and missing live readiness command signal.
2. [x] T2 (GREEN): add readiness health/reason fields to cortex status payload.
3. [x] T3 (GREEN): implement deterministic failure-mode classification for cortex readiness.
4. [x] T4 (GREEN): add live readiness validation command for authenticated cortex probe + status assertion.
5. [x] T5 (REGRESSION): update/extend gateway cortex tests for new readiness contract fields and failure modes.
6. [x] T6 (VERIFY): run fmt/clippy/scoped gateway tests + live validation command.
