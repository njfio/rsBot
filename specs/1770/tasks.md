# Issue 1770 Tasks

Status: Implementing

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add cadence policy contract tests for policy/checklist/script
enforcement and docs discoverability.

T2: add cadence policy JSON and checklist template artifacts.

T3: implement cadence-check script with fixture/live comment input and policy
threshold evaluation.

T4: update roadmap docs with cadence-check workflow and asset references.

T5: run targeted and regression test matrix; capture evidence in issue/PR.

## Tier Mapping

- Unit: policy/checklist/script existence and schema validation
- Functional: in-window and stale-update cadence evaluations
- Integration: docs reference checks and fixture/live command contracts
- Regression: missing-update and threshold-edge failures
- Conformance: C-01..C-05 mapping validated in contract tests
