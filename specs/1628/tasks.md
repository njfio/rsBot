# Issue 1628 Tasks

Status: Implemented

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add failing expectation in
`test-training-crate-boundary-plan.sh` for `training-boundary-set-c` completion.

T2: update boundary-plan generator defaults to complete set-c with explicit
retention scope for `#1628`.

T3: regenerate boundary artifacts and align guide documentation.

T4: run scoped verification, including targeted training crate test commands.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: set-c completed status and docs alignment
- Regression: ambiguous-count/owner-surface invariants remain enforced
- Integration: targeted training crate test pass under retained boundaries
