# Issue 1758 Tasks

Status: Implementing

## Ordered Tasks

T1 (tests-first): add RED contract tests for policy/template/docs coherence.

T2: implement `tasks/policies/doc-quality-remediation-policy.json` with
severity classes, SLA targets, checklist items, and closure proof fields.

T3: implement `tasks/templates/doc-quality-remediation-tracker.md` and
`docs/guides/doc-quality-remediation.md`.

T4: update `docs/README.md` index and run targeted test matrix to GREEN.

## Tier Mapping

- Functional: policy/template/docs artifacts exist and include required fields
- Conformance: closure proof fields and SLA definitions match spec
- Regression: policy/template/docs alignment checks catch drift
